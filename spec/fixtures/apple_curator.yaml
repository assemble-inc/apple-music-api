    :editorialNotes:
      :standard: "Metal is an ever-evolving journey of distorted guitars, huge orchestral
        arrangements, howling vocals, and massive dose of aggression. Good luck pinning
        down a definition; in metal, even the subgenres have subgenres. Born in the
        late ’60s, metal has produced some of the most extreme sounds around. While
        the genre is most commonly associated with loud and aggressive sounds, there
        are other variations—sludge, avant-garde, drone, doom—that unfold in slower
        waves of distorted guitars. Metal encompasses the Sunset Strip sleaze of Guns
        ‘N Roses, the grindcore of Carcass, the funk-metal of Faith No More, the avant-garde
        drone of Sunn 0))), the stadium-filling thrash of Metallica, and much more.
        \n<br /><br />\nIf there was one band that drew the blueprint, it was Black
        Sabbath. You can hear echoes of Sabbath in just about every metal band that
        came after them, from Venom to Beartooth. The early ‘80s brought us Judas
        Priest, Iron Maiden, and Motörhead—leaders of the New Wave of British Heavy
        Metal. In the middle of the decade, many underground scenes developed—like
        black, death, thrash—that continue to thrive today. It went from a cult following
        to a massive audience with the thrash of the big four (Metallica, Slayer,
        Megadeth, Anthrax), the hair metal of the late ‘80s (Mötley Crüe, Ozzy Osbourne)
        the nu-metal of the ’90s (Korn, Limp Bizkit), metalcore of the ‘00s (Dillinger
        Escape Plan, Killswitch Engage, Hatebreed), and the new bands of today. The
        diversity is part of what makes metal so exciting. If you’re into banging
        your head and loud guitars, then there’s a definitely metal band for you."
